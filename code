Choose names thoughtfully.
Communicate your intent with name.
Avoid disinformation, name should say what it means and mean what it says.
Prnounceable names.
Avoid encodings.
Clean code should always read like well written prose.
    variable - noun
    class    - noun
    method   - verb
    boolean  - predicate
Scope rule
    Variable name should be short in tiny scope but long in larger scope.
    Function name should be short in long scope but long in short scope.
    Class name should be long for public class, short name for private class.
Function
    try not to pass more than 3 parameters.
    try not to pass boolean as argument.
    A function that changes state should not return value and vice-versa.
