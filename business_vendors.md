# Golden rules of vendor selection
1. To pick a partner of right size, start with vendors for whom the volume of your business represents between 1 and 20% of their revenue stream. 
1. If looking at huge vendors, apply your calculations to division level.
1. Focus on providers with track record in similar domain rather than generalists.
1. Use professional network to gain access at top and start with vendors whose top brass is known.
1. Check for certifications like CMMI, ISO etc and process they deploy internally.
1. If you have employees who have relation or familar with certain vendor, try those.
