I thought I should give more thought on this. Who is getting ripped and where? This is not about Modi, Yogi, BJP or andh bhakti. So, keep that out.

Lets say McDonalds' cost to mfg of each burger is Rs100. Say, they paid 18% taxes on this cost while buying raw material, so Rs18. Total cost of burger for them is Rs118. They take Rs18 ITC and save this amount. In reality, however, cost would be no more than Rs10-20 and input tax probably Rs5-10 per burger. But let's go with this inflated pricing. McDonalds sells burger for 120, so making a profit of 120-100= Rs20 on each burger and adds 18% GST to consumer.

Now, GST reduces to 5% but probably even for their raw materials too. Let's say, now cost of mfg is Rs90 but they get no input tax credit, which lets say is still Rs18. So, there total cost of mfg now is 90+18 = Rs108. Earlier, they made Rs20 profit but now thet make 135-108= Rs37 profit.

What is wrong in this logic? You guys know more about GST, so help me understand why McDonalds in not making profit on cost of consumers like you and me?
