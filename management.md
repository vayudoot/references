1. The Mixers - They have strong sense of dedication, are loyal team members, patient, sympathetic, understanding, dependable, and great at keeping pace.

# Disciplining the employee
1. Employee discipline should be done in private, never humiliate an employee.

1. “I know we both want you to be successful, so let’s talk about how we can improve the results you are getting.”
1. Performance should be a conversation and not monologue

# Firing
There are two types of dismissal - 1. due to performance (which is more controlled yet longer) and, 2. due to company wide decision (which is short, crisp but tough for employee, team and company).
1. If you have done your job right, dismissal should not be a surprise for the employee.
1. But even better is to have him actually thank you for removing him for the position.
1. If you have communicated openly with employee and made her a part of the attempted performance improvement process, it is very likely she will realize that her skills are not a match for a job.
1. Sudden firings are always wrong, except in cases of dishonesty or violence.
1. Never fire anyone when you are angry.
1. Dismissal incurs costs such as - severance pay, transitional health benefits, outplacement assistance. In addition time might be spent in replacement.
1. Satisfy yourself that training was done well and clearly understood
1. Go over employee’s aptitude tests, job application, other hiring data on chance that you may have missed something.
1. Meet with employee to discuss her current level of performance, expected performance, and how to reach there.
1. Assess if she desires to improve or if she finds her current performance acceptable.
1. From here on, desirable outcome will be to bring up performance by working with her. Second outcome would be to have her thank you when she is dismissed.
1. Key to both outcomes is communication. Be very clear that her job is at risk. Also that you are willing to work with her if she is committed to success.
1. Put goals and agreed actions to be in writing. Just a quick single page list with clearly defined tasks along with dates. Possibly get signature from employee on page and keep it as reference.
1. Next meeting with employee should be soon. More than a month would too long. At that time actions and goals need to be updated and signed again.
1 If she is not improving, the next meeting should be help earlier. If she is improving, more time can be allowed. This process will continue until employee is performing up or is dismissed.
1. As this process continues, it’ll be clear to employee as well as you if person is suited for the job.
1. Casting the employee’s potential in terms of finding her a suitable position would get a “thank you” from her. Also, other team members are clear that you are committed to them being successful.
1. Once you are convinced that dismissal is only outcome, few alternatives to consider -
  1. can employee handle some other job that is currently available?
  1. If opening coming up in other area, can she contribute there?
  1. Is company large enough that employee can move to some other org and be useful there?
  1. Even though employee won’t like being fired, can procedure be made such that she feels she was given every opportunity to be successful?
1. Documentation of underperforming employee’s results is critically important.
1. You must be absolutely certain in your mind that dismissal is deserved. You must be sure that you are being as objective as possible.
