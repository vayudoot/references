# Methods for evaluating project viability
1. Three steps to financial evaluation -
   1. Establish "relevant" cash flow
   1. Figure of merit
   1. Come up with an acceptance criteria for giving the go-ahead on a project

# Relevant cash flow
1. Should only include incremental after tax free cash flows
1. There are five recommended considerations in calculating relevant cash flow -
   1. Self-generating working capital, or spontaneous capital, refers to fact that when project begins there will be an opportunity to fund a portion of it with noninterest bearing debt, such as accounts payable and taxes payable.
   1. Sunk costs are expenditures that have already been made and connot be undone whether project goes forward or not. They should not be included in calculations of relevant cash flow.
   1. Allocated expenses, similar to sunk costs, are usually overhead expenses that the company apportions to its different operating segments, projects, or divisions. If these exist, they should not be included in calculations of relevant cash flow.
   1. Excess capacity are resources which are not going to cost the company any more money whether a project happens or not.
   1. Financing costs should be omitted from calculations.
